A simple one page site for the rapper Childish Gambino. It features a bio section, as well as sections for his music videos and tour dates. I focused on becoming more comfortable with responsive design, without a CSS framework. It was also an opportunity to get more familiar with Flexbox and CSS Grid. The interactive animations were developed with JQuery. I designed the site in Photoshop first and then converted that design into HTML and CSS.
