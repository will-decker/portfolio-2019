A portfolio site to showcase my web design and development projects. One of my goals, when building my portfolio, was to improve my skills with React and other modern front-end technologies. I found that the static site generator Gatsby would be perfect for this. It was a great way to challenge myself and get more experience building a site from the ground up with React, Webpack and NodeJS. Gatsby also makes it easy to add more features and update my site in the future.
