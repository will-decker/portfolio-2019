### A simple one page site, promoting the music of Childish Gambino.

The site features his bio, a selection of music videos and tour dates. It was inspired by his 2018 song, "This is America". When creating this, one of the goals was to keep it minimal and image driven, almost like a magazine layout. At the time, I wanted to focus on getting more familiar with responsive design using Flexbox and CSS Grid.
