A custom made website for a professional organizing business. Built as a static site using Bootstrap and then converted into a dynamic WordPress theme. The conversion to a WordPress theme required me to learn and use PHP to add features to the site. This included creating custom fields, allowing the client to edit information. I also added a blog section and integrated sign up for the client's Mailchimp mailing list into the theme.
