The time has finally come for me to start a blog. It's something I have explored in the past and I've been wanting to get back into it. With my recent career transition into web development, I have discovered a passion for coding and creating websites and apps. I want to use this blog as a way to share what I'm working on and also educate people that are interested in getting into web development.
