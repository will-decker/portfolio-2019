### GIF Finder is a web app using GIPHYâ€™s API to power the search feature.

GIFs displayed in the search results are fetched from GIPHY through a Node proxy server. Other features include an infinite scroll of search results and a lightbox display of the GIF when a result is clicked. The lightbox also displays a link to share the GIF.
