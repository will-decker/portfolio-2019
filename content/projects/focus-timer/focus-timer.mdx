### My version of a Pomodoro Timer, used to set time intervals for focusing on tasks.

The user is able to select different timers based on the Pomodoro Technique, as well as an extended and custom timer. When the timer hits zero an alarm sounds, letting the user know the focus session or break has ended. Since it's a simple app, I also focused on adding features such as a message letting the user know when the timer would end, displaying the timer in the page title and making the app fully responsive.
