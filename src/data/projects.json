    "description": "This is a custom made website for a professional organizing business. It was first built as a static site using Bootstrap and then converted into a dynamic WordPress theme. The conversion to a WordPress theme required me to learn and use PHP in order to add certain functionalities to the dynamic site. This included creating custom fields, allowing the business to edit information on the site, as well as building a blog section and incorporating older blog posts. I was responsible for everything from the initial design and build to final deployment of the website.",

    "description": "A simple one page tribute site for the rapper Childish Gambino. Features a bio section, as well as sections for his music videos and tour dates. When deciding on how to build the site, I knew I wanted to focus on becoming more comfortable with making the site responsive without using a CSS framework, like Bootstrap.  It was also an opportunity to get more familiar with Flexbox and CSS Grid.",
