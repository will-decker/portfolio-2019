GIF Finder is a web app based on GIPHY and using GIPHYâ€™s Developer API to power the search feature, providing the GIFs displayed in the search results. Other features include an infinite scroll of search results and a lightbox display of the GIF when a result is clicked. The lightbox also displays a link to share the GIF.
