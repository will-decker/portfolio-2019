A simple one page site to promote the music of Childish Gambino. It features a bio section, as well as sections for his music videos and tour dates. This site was inspired by his 2018 hit song, "This is America". When building this, I focused on responsive design, without a CSS framework. It was also an opportunity to get more familiar with Flexbox and CSS Grid.
