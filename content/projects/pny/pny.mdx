### At my full-time position, I oversee PNY's graphics team and websites.

We take care of pny.com updates, landing pages, e-commerce, marketing emails, social post assets, newsletters and blog posts. The team also maintains the PNY Partner Portal, a private WordPress site for commercial sales partners and resellers of PNY products. Print projects including packaging, product brochures and promo flyers are also completed by the team.
