        <h1>Hi,</h1>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m Will Decker, a designer, developer and animator based in New
          Jersey. I have over a decade of experience freelancing as a motion
          designer in New York City. Recently, I expanded my skillset to include
          web design and development. I love learning new things, problem
          solving and creating.
